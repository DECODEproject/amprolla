amprolla
========

amprolla is an apt repository merger originally intended for use with
the [Devuan](https://devuan.org) infrastructure. This version is the
third iteration of the software. The original version of amprolla was
not performing well in terms of speed, and the second version was never
finished - therefore this version has emerged.
